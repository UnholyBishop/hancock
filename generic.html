                <p>Percussion Camp, July 18-22.  This is the first camp of the summer and all percussionists are required to  attend.  It is during this camp that the line will start working on marching basics, technique and start on music for the halftime show.  They will meet from 8:00AM to 5:00PM each day with lunch from 12:00-1:00.  

 Rookie Marching Camp, July 18-22. This camp is for ALL first year students and leadership team and its purpose is to teach them our marching style.  Attendance at this camp is REQUIRED so that the student has a basic knowledge of marching before we actually begin to learn drill for the show.  In the event that the student is unable to attend this very important camp, they will be made an alternate. We will be outdoors so comfortable clothing, hats, sunglasses and sunscreen are in order.     

Guard Camp, July 18-22. This camp is for Color Guard ONLY and will run from 8:00AM until 5:00PM.  This is when the guard begins to work on basic equipment skills, body movement, and routines.  They will also be working on this during band camp, but this is a more concentrated session.  Should already have $150 towards color guard fees for uniform cost.

​  Band Camp, July 25-July 29.  This camp is VERY IMPORTANT and is held at Hancock High School from 8:00AM-8:00PM.  This is an intense week of rehearsal where we finally put the feet to music and the show begins to take shape.  All band members are REQUIRED to attend.  Those who can not, will become shadows or alternates and won’t have a permanent spot in the show unless someone else has to drop out.

Rehearsal Day, Aug 2.  This will take place from 5PM-9PM at the band hall. This is a time for us to polish what we have done up to this point and give the members a taste of what Friday night football games are like.  We will march into the stadium and file into the stands.  Just like we will do for the games.  Then the band will come out of stands for a warm up, then hit the field under the lights and perform for YOU! A special performance for the parents of the band program.</p>
